# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview
This project seeks to analyze cryptocurrencies using classification techniques and unsupervised machine learning.  Using Jupyter Notebooks, Python, and Pandas, algorithms will be created to train and test data to analyze cryptocurrencies for investment viability.  Scikit-learn libraries for pandas will be used to scale the data and train algorithms to make predictions and create visualizations.  
## Software
•	Jupyter Notebooks
•	Python
•	Pandas
•	Hvplot
•	Plotly
•	Sckikit-learn preprocessing, PCA, Kmeans
## Summary
The crypto_data dataset was cleaned of unnecessary, redundant, or null columns and rows using the methods described above.  Cryptocurrencies were scaled and grouped into 4 classes using Scikit-Learn.  2D and 3D plots were created using Hvplot and plotly.  PCA was implemented to reduce the number of dimensions to improve the usability of machine learning for this analysis. The result is a visual representation of cryptocurrencies based on scaled values of the total coins limited by the currency, and the number of coins that have been mined.  The issue with this project is that the groups/classes for the cryptocurrencies are not defined.  Determining which group/class is best of investment cannot be determined without additional information assigned to the primary components, and subsequently the group/class.
